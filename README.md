# MP-2: Generate Your Unique RoboBot

Hey there! This is my **MP-2** project for **CS701**. 
1. It lets you generate unique, funny-looking robots by just entering a name. 
2. Each time you generate a bot, it gets stored in history so you can select and view any of your past creations. 

## Features

- **Generate a Bot**: Just enter a name, and click "Generate" to create a unique robot image.
- **History**: After generating a bot, the bot gets added to the history. You can use the dropdown to select any bot from the past and view it again.
- **Details**: Each bot comes with its **ID**, **name**, **timestamp** of creation, and **image size**.

## How to Use

1. Enter a **name** in the input field.
2. Click **Generate** to create a new robot.
3. Once generated, the bot will show up with its details.
4. Check out the **history dropdown** to select any bot youâ€™ve created before!

## Tech Used

- **React** for the frontend.
- **CSS** for styling (using App.css).
- The robot images are generated using [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/).
